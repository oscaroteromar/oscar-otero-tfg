	Firstly, I would like to thank my tutor \textit{Carmen Peláez Moreno} for all her help and commitment throughout this work. I hope the EMPATIA project achieves all its goals and is applied to real life situations in the foreseeable future.
	
	A big thank you to all the friends I have made during my university years. Specially, I would like to point out \textit{Irina Antich Moreno} and \textit{Daniel Barrejón Moreno} for being such good classmates, friends and always being helpful to solve any kind of doubt.
	
	To the two people that I will always be grateful, \textit{my parents}. Thank you for making this possible, allowing me to study in this University and always being supportive under any circumstances.
	
	To my older sister \textit{Lucía}, who has always been a role model since I was kid. No matter the pass of the years, everything will always be like in the beginning.
	
	To my girlfriend \textit{Ana}, who has been there for me during all these years, caring so much about me everyday and always making me happy.
	
	Finally, to my grandparents, specially \textit{Antonio} and \textit{Leonor}, who have always worked very hard to make their families prosper. My sister and I are the final result of those efforts.

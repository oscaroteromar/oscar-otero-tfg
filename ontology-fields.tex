		ID & This field includes the Knowledge Graph \acrfull{mid} that best describes the sound or its source. It is used as a primary identifier for the class. \\
		\hline
		Display name & Short name formed by one or two words that identifies the audio class. It sometimes includes a small alternative separated by a comma so it does not feel ambiguous. \\
		\hline
		Description & One or two explaining sentences so the meaning of the category is more defined. These can be extracted from Wikipedia or WordNet. \\
		\hline
		Examples & At least one example of the label is provided as a URL of a YouTube video. \\
		\hline
		Children & An array filled by the \acrfull{mid}s from all immediate children of the class. \\
		\hline
		Restrictions & It specifies if the category in question either has been discarded or there are no audio clips under it. \\

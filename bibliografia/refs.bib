abstract = {Violence continues being an important problem in the society. Thousands of people suffer its effects every day and statistics show this number has maintained or almost increased recently. In the modern environment of smart cities there is a necessity to develop a system capable of detecting if a violent situation is taking place or not. In this paper we present an automatic acoustic violence detection system for smart cities, integrating both signal processing and pattern recognition techniques. The proposed software has been implemented in three steps: feature extraction in time and frequency domain, genetic algorithm implementation in order to select the best features, and classification to take a binary decision. Results derived from the experiments show that MFCCs are the best features for violence detection, and others like pitch or short time energy have also a good performance. In other words, features that can distinguish between voiced and unvoiced frames seem to be a good election for violence detection in real environments.},

abstract = {Multimedia event detection (MED) is the task of detecting given events (e.g. birthday party, making a sandwich) in a large collection of video clips. While visual features and automatic speech recognition typically provide the best features for this task, nonspeech audio can also contribute useful information, such as crowds cheering, engine noises, or animal sounds. MED is typically formulated as a two-stage process: the first stage generates clip-level feature representations, often by aggregating frame-level features; the second stage performs binary or multi-class classification to decide whether a given event occurs in a video clip. Both stages are usually performed «statically», i.e. using only local temporal information, or bag-of-words models. In this paper, we introduce longer-range temporal information with deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for both stages. We classify each audio frame among a set of semantic units called «noisemes» the sequence of frame-level confidence distributions is used as a variable-length clip-level representation. Such confidence vector sequences are then fed into long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for clip-level classification. We observe improvements in both frame-level and clip-level performance compared to SVM and feed-forward neural network baselines.},

abstract = {The primary purpose for pursuing this research is to present a modular approach that enables reliable automatic bird species identification on the basis of their sound emissions in the field. A practical and complete computer-based framework is proposed to detect and time-stamp particular bird species in continuous real field recordings. Acoustic detection of avian sounds can be used for the automatized monitoring of multiple bird taxa and querying in long-term recordings for species of interest for researchers, conservation practitioners, and decision makers, such as environmental indicator taxa and threatened species. This work describes two novel procedures and offers an open modular framework that detects and time-stamps online calls and songs of target bird species and is fast enough to report results in reasonable time for non-processed field recordings of many thousands files and is generic enough to accommodate any species. The framework is evaluated on two large corpora of real field data, targeting the calls and songs of American Robin Turdus migratorius, a Northamerican oscine passerine (true songbird) and the Common Kingfisher Alcedo atthis, a non-passerine species with a wide distribution throughout Eurasia and North Africa. With the aim of promoting the widespread use of digital autonomous recording units (ARUs) and species recognition technologies the processing code and a large corpus of audio recordings is provided in order to enable other researchers to perform and assess comparative experiments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The "bag-of-frames" approach (BOF) to audio pattern recognition represents signals as the long-term statistical distribution of their local spectral features. This approach has proved nearly optimal for simulating the auditory perception of natural and human environments (or soundscapes), and is also the most predominent paradigm to extract high-level descriptions from music signals. However, recent studies show that, contrary to its application to soundscape signals, BOF only provides limited performance when applied to polyphonic music signals. This paper proposes to explicitly examine the difference between urban soundscapes and polyphonic music with respect to their modeling with the BOF approach. First, the application of the same measure of acoustic similarity on both soundscape and music data sets confirms that the BOF approach can model soundscapes to near-perfect precision, and exhibits none of the limitations observed in the music data set. Second, the modification of this measure by two custom homogeneity transforms reveals critical differences in the temporal and statistical structure of the typical frame distribution of each type of signal. Such differences may explain the uneven performance of BOF algorithms on soundscapes and music signals, and suggest that their human perception rely on cognitive processes of a different nature.},

From the highly variable recordings, a large number of spectral, cepstral, energy and voicing-related audio features are extracted. Using a sliding window approach, classification is performed on short windows. SVM are used to classify these short segments, and a majority voting scheme is employed to get a decision for longer recordings. On the official development set of the challenge, an accuracy of 73 {\%} is achieved. SVM are compared with a nearest neighbour classifier and an approach called Latent Perceptual Indexing, whereby SVM achieve the best results.

This corresponds to the accuracy of classifying between 61 events when mixed with ambient background noise at 0dB signal-to-noise ratio.

For example, one in three women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15; one in five women has experienced stalking; every second woman has been confronted with one or more forms of sexual harassment. What emerges is a picture of extensive abuse that affects many women's lives but is systematically under-reported to the authorities. The scale of violence against women is therefore not reflected by official data. This FRA survey is the first of its kind on violence against women across the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU). It is based on interviews with 42,000 women across the EU, who were asked about their experiences of physical, sexual and psychological violence, including incidents of intimate partner violence (‘domestic violence'). The survey also included questions on stalking, sexual harassment, and the role played by new technologies in women's experiences of abuse. In addition, it asked about their experiences of violence in childhood. Based on the detailed findings, FRA suggests courses of action in different areas that are touched by violence against women and go beyond the narrow confines of criminal law, ranging from employment and health to the medium of new technologies.},

In this work we try to detect violent situations on two different acoustic databases through the use of crossed information from one of them into the other. The system has been divided into three stages: feature extraction, feature selection based on genetic algorithms and classification to take a binary decision. Results focus on comparing performance loss when a database is evaluated with features selected on itself, or selection based in the other database.

On contrary, such events are more discerning from audio cues. In this work, we propose a hierarchical audio-visual surveillance framework for elevators. Audio analytic module acts as the front line detector to monitor for such events. This means audio cue is the main determining source to infer the event occurrence. The secondary inference process involves queries to visual analytic module to build-up the evidences leading to event detection.

Human listeners are able to perceptually segregate one sound source from an acoustic mixture, such as a single voice from a mixture of other voices and music at a busy cocktail party. How can we engineer “machine listening” systems that achieve this perceptual feat? Albert Bregmans book Auditory Scene Analysis, published in 1990, drew an analogy between the perception of auditory scenes and visual scenes, and described a coherent framework for understanding the perceptual organization of sound. His account has stimulated much interest in computational studies of hearing. Such studies are motivated in part by the demand for practical sound separation systems, which have many applications including noiserobust automatic speech recognition, hearing prostheses, and automatic music transcription. This emerging field has become known as computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). Computational Auditory Scene Analysis: Principles, Algorithms, and Applications provides a comprehensive and coherent account of the state of the art in CASA, in terms of the underlying principles, the algorithms and system architectures that are employed, and the potential applications of this exciting new technology. With a Foreword by Bregman, its chapters are written by leading researchers and cover a wide range of topics including: Estimation of multiple fundamental frequenciesFeaturebased and modelbased approaches to CASASound separation based on spatial locationProcessing for reverberant environmentsSegregation of speech and musical signalsAutomatic speech recognition in noisy environmentsNeural and perceptual modeling of auditory organizationThe text is written at a level that will be accessible to graduate students and researchers from related science and engineering disciplines.

While many recognition tasks have traditionally employed inertial sensors, acoustic-based methods offer the benefit of capturing rich contextual information, which can be useful when discriminating complex activities. Given the emergence of deep learning techniques and leveraging new, large-scaled multi-media datasets, this paper revisits the opportunity of training audio-based classifiers without the onerous and time-consuming task of annotating audio data. We propose a framework for audio-based activity recognition that makes use of millions of embedding features from public online video sound clips. Based on the combination of oversampling and deep learning approaches, our framework does not require further feature processing or outliers filtering as in prior work. We evaluated our approach in the context of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) by recognizing 15 everyday activities with 14 participants in their own homes, achieving 64.2{\%} and 83.6{\%} averaged within-subject accuracy in terms of top-1 and top-3 classification respectively. Individual class performance was also examined in the paper to further study the co-occurrence characteristics of the activities and the robustness of the framework.},

abstract = {The human activity that takes place in meeting-rooms or class-rooms is reflected in a rich variety of acoustic events, either produced by the human body or by objects handled by humans, so the determination of both the identity of sounds and their position in time may help to detect and describe that human activity. Additionally, detection of sounds other than speech may be useful to enhance the robustness of speech technologies like automatic speech recognition. Automatic detection and classification of acoustic events is the objective of this thesis work. It aims at processing the acoustic signals collected by distant microphones in meeting-room or classroom environments to convert them into symbolic descriptions corresponding to a listener's perception of the different sound events that are present in the signals and their sources. First of all, the task of acoustic event classification is faced using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, which are motivated by the scarcity of training data. A confusion-matrix-based variable-feature-set clustering scheme is developed for the multiclass recognition problem, and tested on the gathered database. With it, a higher classification rate than the GMM-based technique is obtained, arriving to a large relative average error reduction with respect to the best result from the conventional binary tree scheme. Moreover, several ways to extend SVMs to sequence processing are compared, in an attempt to avoid the drawback of SVMs when dealing with audio data, i.e. their restriction to work with fixed-length vectors, observing that the dynamic time warping kernels work well for sounds that show a temporal structure. Furthermore, concepts and tools from the fuzzy theory are used to investigate, first, the importance of and degree of interaction among features, and second, ways to fuse the outputs of several classification systems. The developed AEC systems are tested also by participating in several international evaluations from 2004 to 2006, and the results are reported. The second main contribution of this thesis work is the development of systems for detection of acoustic events. The detection problem is more complex since it includes both classification and determination of the time intervals where the sound takes place. Two system versions are developed and tested on the datasets of the two CLEAR international evaluation campaigns in 2006 and 2007. Two kinds of databases are used: two databases of isolated acoustic events, and a database of interactive seminars containing a significant number of acoustic events of interest. Our developed systems, which consist of SVM-based classification within a sliding window plus post-processing, were the only submissions not using HMMs, and each of them obtained competitive results in the corresponding evaluation. Speech activity detection was also pursued in this thesis since, in fact, it is a – especially important – particular case of acoustic event detection. An enhanced SVM training approach for the speech activity detection task is developed, mainly to cope with the problem of dataset reduction. The resulting SVM-based system is tested with several NIST Rich Transcription (RT) evaluation datasets, and it shows better scores than our GMM-based system, which ranked among the best systems in the RT06 evaluation. Finally, it is worth mentioning a few side outcomes from this thesis work. As it has been carried out in the framework of the CHIL EU project, the author has been responsible for the organization of the above mentioned international evaluations in acoustic event classification and detection, taking a leading role in the specification of acoustic event classes, databases, and evaluation protocols, and, especially, in the proposal and implementation of the various metrics that have been used. Moreover, the detection systems have been implemented in the UPC's smart-room and work in real time for purposes of testing and demonstration.},

abstract = {The present research on cognitive categories mediates between individual experiences of soundscapes and collective representations shared in language and elaborated as knowledge. This approach focuses on meanings attributed to soundscapes in an attempt to bridge the gap between individual perceptual categories and sociological representations. First, results of several free categorisation experiments are presented, namely the categorical structures elicited using soundscape recordings and the underlying principles of organisation derived from the analysis of verbal comments. People categorised sound samples on the basis of semantic features that integrate perceptual ones. Specifically, soundscapes reflecting human activity were perceived as more pleasant than soundscapes where mechanical sounds were predominant. Second, the linguistic exploration of free-format verbal description of soundscapes indicated that the meanings attributed to sounds act as a determinant for sound quality evaluations. Soundscape evaluations are therefore qualitative first as they are semiotic in nature as grounded in cultural values given to different types of activities. Physical descriptions of sound properties have to be reconsidered as cues pointing to diverse cognitive objects to be identified first rather as the only adequate, exhaustive and objective description of the sound itself. Finally, methodological and theoretical consequences of these findings are drawn, highlighting the need to address not only noise annoyance but rather sound quality of urban environments. To do so, cognitive evaluations must be conducted in the first place to identify relevant city users' categories of soundscapes and then to use physical measurement to characterize corresponding acoustic events. {\textcopyright} S.

abstract = {Violence is autonomous, the contents that one would not let children to see in movies or web videos. This is a challenging problem due to strong content variations among the positive instances. To solve this problem, implementation of deep neural network to classify the violence content in videos is proposed. Currently, deep neural network has shown its efficiency in natural language processing, fraud detection, social media, text classification, image classification. Regardless of the conventional methods applied to overcome this issue, but these techniques seem insufficiently accurate and does not adopt well to certain webs or user needs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the classification performances on violence video using Deep Neural Network (DNN). Hence, in this paper different architectures of hidden layers and hidden nodes in DNN have been implemented using the try-error method and equation based method, to examine the effect of the number of hidden layers and hidden nodes to the classification performance. From the results, it indicates 53{\%} accuracy rate for try and error approach, meanwhile for equation based approach it indicates 51{\%} accuracy rate.},

abstract = {In this work we present a system to automatically learn features from audio in an unsupervised manner. Our method first learns an overcomplete dictionary which can be used to sparsely decompose log-scaled spectrograms. It then trains an efficient encoder which quickly maps new inputs to approximations of their sparse representations using the learned dictionary. This avoids expensive iterative procedures usually required to infer sparse codes. We then use these sparse codes as inputs for a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our system achieves 83.4{\%} accuracy in predicting genres on the GTZAN dataset, which is competitive with current state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the use of a simple linear classifier combined with a fast feature extraction system allows our approach to scale well to large datasets. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

We evaluate and compare the feature extraction techniques based on Fourier transform, linear predictive coding, wavelet transform and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) in combination with the classification methods based on vector quantization, Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and artificial neural networks, using receiver operating characteristic curves. We propose the use of an optimized threshold to discriminate the wheezing class from the normal one. Also, post-processing filter is employed to considerably improve the classification accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach based on MFCC coefficients combined to GMM is well adapted to classify respiratory sounds in normal and wheeze classes.

abstract = {Recently unsupervised learning algorithms have been successfully used to represent data in many of machine recognition tasks. In particular, sparse feature learning algorithms have shown that they can not only discover meaningful structures from raw data but also outperform many hand-engineered features. In this paper, we apply the sparse feature learning approach to acoustic scene classification. We use a sparse restricted Boltzmann machine to capture manyfold local acoustic structures from audio data and represent the data in a high-dimensional sparse feature space given the learned structures. For scene classification, we summarize the local features by pooling over audio scene data. While the feature pooling is typically performed over uniformly divided segments, we suggest a new pooling method, which first detects audio events and then performs pooling only over detected events, considering the irregular occurrence of audio events in acoustic scene data. We evaluate the learned features on the IEEE AASP Challenge development set, comparing them with a baseline model using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The results show that learned features outperform MFCCs, event-based pooling achieves higher accuracy than uniform pooling and, furthermore, a combination of the two methods performs even better than either one used alone. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

To follow up on this resolution, on Oct 3 this year, WHO released the first World Report on Violence and Health. The report analyses different types of violence including chil abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, elder abuse, self-directed violence, and collective violence. For all these types of violence, the report explores the magnitude of the health and social effects, the risk and protective factors, and the types of prevention efforts that have been initiated. The launch of the report will be followed by a 1-year Global Campaign on Violence Prevention, focusing on implementation of the recommendations.

abstract = {Our understanding of etiology of obesity and overweight is incomplete due to lack of objective and accurate methods for monitoring of ingestive behavior (MIB) in the free-living population. Our research has shown that frequency of swallowing may serve as a predictor for detecting food intake, differentiating liquids and solids, and estimating ingested mass. This paper proposes and compares two methods of acoustical swallowing detection from sounds contaminated by motion artifacts, speech, and external noise. Methods based on mel-scale Fourier spectrum, wavelet packets, and support vector machines are studied considering the effects of epoch size, level of decomposition, and lagging on classification accuracy. The methodology was tested on a large dataset (64.5 h with a total of 9966 swallows) collected from 20 human subjects with various degrees of adiposity. Average weighted epoch-recognition accuracy for intravisit individual models was 96.8{\%}, which resulted in 84.7{\%} average weighted accuracy in detection of swallowing events. These results suggest high efficiency of the proposed methodology in separation of swallowing sounds from artifacts that originate from respiration, intrinsic speech, head movements, food ingestion, and ambient noise. The recognition accuracy was not related to body mass index, suggesting that the methodology is suitable for obese individuals. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of an audio-based context recognition system. Here, context recognition refers to the automatic classification of the context or an environment around a device. A system is developed and compared to the accuracy of human listeners in the same task. Particular emphasis is placed on the computational complexity of the methods, since the application is of particular interest in resource-constrained portable devices. Simplistic low-dimensional feature vectors are evaluated against more standard spectral features. Using discriminative training, competitive recognition accuracies are achieved with very low-order hidden Markov models (1-3 Gaussian components). Slight improvement in recognition accuracy is observed when linear data-driven feature transformations are applied to mel-cepstral features. The recognition rate of the system as a function of the test sequence length appears to converge only after about 30 to 60 s. Some degree of accuracy can be achieved even with less than 1-s test sequence lengths. The average reaction time of the human listeners was 14 s, i.e., somewhat smaller, but of the same order as that of the system. The average recognition accuracy of the system was 58{\%} against 69{\%}, obtained in the listening tests in recognizing between 24 everyday contexts. The accuracies in recognizing six high-level classes were 82{\%} for the system and 88{\%} for the subjects. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important global public health problem, affecting women across the life span and increasing risk for a number of unfavorable health outcomes. Typically conceptualized as a private form of violence, most research has focused on individual-level risk markers. Recently, more scholarly attention has been paid to the role that the residential neighborhood environment may play in influencing the occurrence of IPV. With research accumulating since the 1990s, increasing prominence of the topic, and no comprehensive literature reviews yet undertaken, it is time to take stock of what is known, what remains unknown, and the methods and concepts investigators have considered. In this article, we undertake a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature to date on the relationship between neighborhood environment and IPV, asking, “what is the status of scholarship related to the association between neighborhood environment and IPV occurrence?” Although the literature is young, it is receiving increasing attention from researchers in sociology, public health, criminology, and other fields. Obvious gaps in the literature include limited consideration of nonurban areas, limited theoretical motivation, and limited consideration of the range of potential contributors to environmental effects on IPV—such as built environmental factors or access to services. In addition, explanations of the pathways by which place influences the occurrence of IPV draw mainly from social disorganization theory that was developed in urban settings in the United States and may need to be adapted, especially to be useful in explaining residential environmental correlates of IPV in rural or non-U.S. settings. A more complete theoretical understanding of the relationship between neighborhood environment and IPV, especially considering differences among urban, semiurban, and rural settings and developed and developing country settings, will be necessary to advance research questions and improve policy and intervention responses to reduce the burden of IPV.},

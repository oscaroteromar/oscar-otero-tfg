	\item A complete collection of all desirable labels was prepared so that it can be used to define sound events from real-world aural data.
	\item When labelling an audio event the result must match the criteria of a common listener.
	\item Different categories should be easy to distinguish by an ordinary listener. In the case that two different labels do not satisfy this requirement, these should be merged. With this condition, the plethora of possible labels remains limited.
	\item The distinction of two different classes must be done by relying just on the audio, it cannot be accompanied by image or visual information.
	\item The hierarchy should not be very deep by keeping the number of children per parent class to no more than 10. This also eases the annotation labour.
